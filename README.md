# Report
Repository that will contain the final reports documenting the whole activity

We gotta two main possibilities, some sort of Markdown language like the one in the README.md file, or a generic writer
like MS Word or LibreOffice Writer.

Generaly I think that md or latex will be better, they way more integrated w/ git, so it's easyer to work togheder on it.
Also they provide a decent swag to the project, it will look way more offical and skilled.
